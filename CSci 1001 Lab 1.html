<h2>CSci 1001 Lab 1</h2>

<h3>Creating a simple web page</h3>

<p>In this lab you will write a simple web page. Mor specifically, you
need to do the following:</p>  
<ol>
<li>Start jEdit (go to  <code>Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt;
jEdit4.2</code>, and choose jEdit)
</li>
<li>Open a new file. Save it on the
Desktop (go to Save As) as <code>mypage.html</code></li>
<li>Copy the following header code into your page:
<pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html
PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;!--
Put author information here
--&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;

Your title goes here
&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
</code></pre>
Add the closing <code>body</code> and <code>html</code> tags. Save the file. 
</li>
<li>Open <a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/1001_spring09/examples/first_page.html">this
page</a> in another browser tab (right-click on the link and then
choose "Open Link in New Tab") and use it as an example. Go to View -&gt;  
Page Source to see the html source.</li> 
<li>In the browser window open another tab, go to File  -&gt; Open File,
navigate to Desktop, and open mypage.html. It doesn't have anything in
it yet, but it should show the title.</li>
<li>In yet another tab open the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">XHTML validator</a>. Go to "validate
by File uploading" and browse to your file. If there are any errors,
please correct them, save the file and revalidate. </li>  
<li>One by one add the features listed below to your page. Save the
file after each change, reload it in the browser (click the cicrle
arrow in the browser toolbar) and check it using 
the validator. When you are adding HTML elements, make sure to add the
opening and closing tags first, and then put the text in between
them. <br>
The contents of your page doesn't matter - add any random text. 
<br>
Here is the list of features that you need to add to your page:
<ol>
<li>A header</li>
<li>A paragraph with at least one other element (such as
<code>cite</code>, 
<code>dfn</code>, etc.) included in it. </li>
<li>A list with at least two items.</li>
<li>A link to any other web site (UMM web site or weather.com is
fine). Click on the link to make sure that it works.</li> 
<li>A horizontal rule <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> (note that it is a
self-closing tag)</li>
<li>An image. You can add an image in one of two ways:
<ul>
<li>
Copy an image from any web page: right-click on it, choose "Save Image as", 
and save it on Desktop. Then include it into
the page using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Use the example web page
as a sample (however, you don't have the <code>images</code> folder,
so include just the file name, not the folder name). 
</li>
<li>Use a link to an image on another web site. To do this, right-click on the 
image and choose "Copy Image Location". Paste the location as the value of the 
<code>src</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> tag</li>
</ul>
Make sure to add the <code>alt</code>
attribute. 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding CSS features</h3>
<p>For this part of the lab you need to add a CSS file to set simple
properties of some elements in your web page. Use <a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/1001_spring09/examples/first_page2.html">this 
page</a> and <a href="http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~elenam/1001_spring09/examples/first_style.css">this
CSS file</a> as an example.</p>

<p>Your task is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a new file <code>lab1.css</code> and save it next to your
HTML file.</li>
<li>In your HTML file add a line
<pre><code>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lab1.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>
right before the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag. Save the html
file, re-validate it to make sure that you added the line correctly.  
</li>
<li>
Add the following to your CSS file, saving it and reloading the page
in the browser after every change: 
<ul>
<li>Set the text color and the background color of the entire page 
by setting properties of <code>body</code> tag in the CSS file (see 
the example given in class). You might want to look up color values 
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colornames.asp">here</a>.
<br>
Save the CSS file, repload the page, and make sure that the colors 
appear. Also upload your CSS file to the <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload">CSS 
validator</a> to make sure thta it is correct. Repeat these steps with 
every addition to the CSS file. 
</li> 
<li>
Set a different color for the header and one other tag in your page 
in one css 
declaration. For instance, if you are setting a property for 
<code>h1</code> and <code>em</code>, you write <code>h1, em</code> 
in CSS and then set the property. 
</li>
<li>
Set a border property for an image. Border properties are listed 
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">here</a>. Try 
a different style then the one given in the in-class example (for instance, 
a dashed border instead of a double one). 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>TBA</p> -->


<h3>At the end of the lab</h3>
<ul>
<li>Send your HTML and CSS files by e-mail to me <span class="email">elenam at 
morris.umn.edu</span> and to yourself. Please attach images if you
downloaded  
them to the Desktop. In your e-mail please note whether your work is
finished.</li> 
<li>If you are not finished with all tasks, you may continue working
on the lab at home. In this case please submit it with the problem
set.</li> 
</ul>
